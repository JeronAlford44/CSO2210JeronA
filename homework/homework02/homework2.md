####- What is a computer system?
A computer system is a set of components that all work together to complete a task

####-What are some of the parts of a computer system?
Digital logic, control, machine, system software, assembly language, high level language, and user contributions

####-What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?
With an interpeted language, there is an intermediary application that converts high-level code to machine code. Compiled languages are directly compiled to machine code

####-Is C a compiled language?
Yes, it must be compiled 

####-Who invented the C language?
Dennis Ritchie

####-How long has C been in use?
1972

####-Is a compiler a translator?
Yes, it translate a programming language's code to assembly code

####-Is an assembler a translator?

####-What does the C function atof() do?
it converts ascii characters to a floating point number

####-What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
digital logic later has the hardware that all parts of the computer are ran on. Control layer uses the hardware from the digital logic layer and contains microcode.

####-What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
1. control unit gers next program instruction from the memory
2. the instruction is then decoded so the instruction can be understood
3. ALU executes the decoded instructions

####-What is the purpose of an ALU?
Performs mathematical and bit-wise operations  on integers (inputs come from registers on CPU or other devices)

####-What is a register?
keeps memory adresses of instructions

####-What is one difference between Application software and System software?
Applications software is written for people  and systems software is written for computers

####-Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?
No, it is part of assembly language

####-How many buses are included in the system bus?
3, data bus, address bus, control bus
