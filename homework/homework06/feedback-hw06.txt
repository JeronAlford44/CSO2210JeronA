TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 83.00/100.00 which is 83% which is a B

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

I don't see where you have put a header in some of the code files so that I
   know how to build the programs.  Because of that, I'll do my best to get
   things working, but at this point, if it doesn't build, you get what you
   get....  sorry.....

problem 1 findGCD: got two assembler errors that 64-bit format doesn't
   support 32-bit addresses.  You need to have a "default rel" in your code
   next to the global and externs.  I put that in and now it assembles.
   However, you also need to have underscore characters in front of the main
   and the "C" functions ~ I get linker errors from gcc without them.  Now I
   get a warning for "no_pie", and when I run it gets a seg fault.

problem 2 gcdFinder & findGCDfunc: findGCDfunc assembles fine and gcdFinder
   compiles fine, but linking with gcc caused an error.  The linker can't
   find "_find_gcd", again because you don't have the underscore.  I fixed
   that for you and now it links and runs.  It gets the right answer, but
   it also gets a seg fault at the end.  No harm no foul on that one.

problem 3 paritygen: Jeezo.... same problem here!  Fixed it for you.  Also,
   you need "_main" for linking with gcc, not "_start".  Fixed that, too.
   Now it assembles and links, but running it gets a seg fault before there
   is any output.

problem 4 whichEndIsUp: perfect.

problem 5 makeNBOC & makeNBOCtest: perfect.

problem 6 makeNBON & makeNBOC: added underscores again for you.  Also, the
   "_main" vs. "_start" thing.  Fixed that for you.  And of course, it gets
   a seg fault.

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework03 ~  91.11% of  5 points =  4.56 points
   homework04 ~  81.11% of  5 points =  4.06 points
   homework05 ~ 100.00% of 10 points = 10.00 points
   homework06 ~  83.00% of 15 points = 12.45 points
                       semester total: 41.07 out of 45.00 = 91.27%
                             which is an A-minus

Great work on all these assignments!  It's been a pleasure having all three
of you in class... have an excellent break!
